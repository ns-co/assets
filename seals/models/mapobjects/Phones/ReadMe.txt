Description :
   This is my first and second public phone mapobjects. It got inspired by an Urban Terror
   texture. I needed a phone for my map so I created the first one. The second one was
   created as a personnal challenge to have a phone of higher quality.

New texture : yes

New shader  : no shaders are needed for the moment but I am thinking of one

 take the light in consideration. For this object to be lightened up by the
 world sourounding, special shader consideration must be taken (if it should
 be the case, please read the comments included inside the shader itself). 

Tools used :
