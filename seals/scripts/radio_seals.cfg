/*
Navy Seals Radio Communication Configuration File

Maximum Radio files is 150.
You can add and remove them dynamically.
Change will be done when the next game starts.

Language Packs would also be possible; People can translate these strings into other language and also record new samples.

the alias "reportingin" is hardcoded. it will auto select the correct message.

Do never change any of the aliases tough. You may add new ones, but changing these aliases will destroy the binding of radio commands as well as the execute radio command menu.
