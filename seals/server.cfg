// Navy Seals: Covert operations - beta 1.91
// default server configuration originally by Defcon-X modified by [BiM]gtk

// also refer to docs/cvars.txt

// once you have setup the server you may use NS:CO Server Variable Editor to
// administrate it at http://nsve.ns-co.net or download it for use on your
// own server at http://www.ns-co.net/files_misc.shtml *shameless plug*

// - THE BASICS SETTINGS -
//   Ive tried to make it so that the server will have perfectly good settings
//   by just customizing the basic settings. Also note that allmost every
//   setting can be changed via NSVE or rcon later.

// admin info
sets Admin "UnnamedAdmin"
sets Email "UnnamedAdmin@Unconfigured"

// server name and message of the day.
set sv_hostname "Navy Seals 1.91 ^1[PB ON]"
set g_motd "Welcome to our server!"

// think carefully about what the server can handle bandwidth and cpu-wise.
set sv_maxclients "12"
set teampointlimit "20"

// the main administration (rcon) password
set rconpassword "secretrcon"

// an amount of private player slots to be used when the regular slots is full.
set sv_privateClients "0"
set sv_privatePassword "secretprivate"

// leave this blank unless you want to make it a private server.
set g_password ""

// enable/disable punkbuster.
pb_sv_enable
//pb_sv_disable

// how to update PB on initial server setup and when new versions come out:
//
// spam "/rcon pb_sv_update" alot and tail -f /path/to/seals.log to check what
// happens, alternatively use pbweb. In both cases repeat the process until
// "/rcon pb_sv_ver" reports the same version as the latest version on the
// http://www.evenbalance.com website listed for Quake III Arena.

// personally I never noticed any difference even with sv_maxrate "25000"

// /rate set high. Having sv_maxrate set to this number does not raise players
