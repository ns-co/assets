						
   Graphtallica Textures - for use in Quake3 Arena			
  --------------------------------[Democritus]-----

This is the Graphtallica Texture set No 8. I converted them all to Quake3
and worte the necessary Shader files. The files are all saved in reduced
quality to reduce the size and improve the gameplay.

I originally did that texture pack for the mappers of [team mirage]. We 
are working on a realistic Q3 conversion. The official sequel to Navy 
Seals for Quake 1 & 2. Visit the homepage at http://nsq3.team-mirage.de 

As the original Graphtallica Texture Set is freeware, these are also 
freeware, but if you happen to include them in a map of yours then credit
me for my conversion work - it took me more time than you might expect - 
and the original creator of the pack by adding the supplied 
readme_textures_graphtallica_8.htm to your zip and by including the 
following text in your readme:

--------

This Map uses Textures of the Graphtallica Texture set No 8, which is freeware.

It was converted for use in Q3a by Democritus [Democritus@team-mirage.de]
