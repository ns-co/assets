Accuracy Skill 
======== 
The accuracy skill allows you to equip your rifle with a scope, this requires an accuracy level of 6 or higher. 
You can also equip your primary weapon with a laser sight if you have an accuracy level of at 4 or higher. 
You can also do this for most sidearms, but it requires an accuracy level of at least 3. 
Accuracy also controls the amount of time the crosshair takes to fade in or out, 
your player will only be able to fire accurately (pin point accuracy, that is) when the crosshair is visible. 

Stealth Skill 
======= 
Stealth allows you to equip most weapons (except rifles, sniper rifles and shotguns) with a silencer. 
You must have a stealth skill of 3 or higher to enable the silencer for your sidearm,
 and 5 or higher to enable it for your primary weapon. 

Here's a list of the other abilities that the stealth skill offers you: 

stealth = 9+ Silent wading through water / swimming on the surface. 
stealth = 8+ Silent movement on special surfaces . 
stealth = 7+ Silent ladder climbing. 
stealth = 6+ Silent movement on concrete surfaces. 
stealth = 6+ No sound when falling a great distance 
stealth = 5+ No sound when falling a medium distance 
stealth = 4+ No sound when falling a small distance 
stealth = 4+ Silent when entering/leaving water (completely) 
stealth = 4+ Silent door opening. 
stealth = 3+ No sound when your head rises above / falls below the water level. 
stealth = 3+ No sound when falling a very small distance / jumping 

Stamina Skill 
======= 
The stamina skill allows your character to sprint for a longer period of time. 
It also helps you regain your actual stamina more quickly. 
If you are wearing armor and you have a low stamina skill, then your character will start breathing heavily as you sprint.
Your character will also be able to sustain a little more damage with a higher stamina skill. 

If you have a stamina level of 5 or higher, you can wear armour without any negative effects on your sprinting ability. 


Speed skill 
====== 
The speed skill allows your character to move faster, this includes crouching, climbing, sprinting, running and walking.

Strength skill 
======== 
The strength skill allows your chracter to handle your weapon's recoil much more easily. 
It also reduces the effects of equipment weight on your overall speed. 
Strength also enables you to equip your rifle with a bayonet, (at level 4 or higher) 
or your shotgun with a duckbill, (at level 5 or higher) which control the spread of pellets from the barrel. 


Technical skill 
======== 
The technical allows you to equip your assault rifle (either the SOCOM M4 or the AK47 ) 
with an underslung grenade launcher. You must have a technical skill of 7 or higher to enable it. 
You can also equip your shotgun with a flashlight (at level 4 or higher). 
A higher technical skill also allows you to throw grenades further and speeds up your bandaging time. 
You can also throw grenades further if you've got a higher techical skilllevel.

Bomb timing: 

diff = ATTACKER TECHNICAL SKILL - DEFENDER TECH SKILL 

Where the attacker is the player that plants the bomb, and the defender is the player attempting to defuse it. 

Example: An attacker with Tech 7 plants the bomb; but the defusing defender only has tech 2. The resulting diff is 5. 

Here is the time, in milliseconds, it takes to defuse one single wire: 
(wrong wires turn red). 

( diff = -9 ) - time = 1000 
( diff = -8 ) - time = 1500 
( diff = -7, -6 ) - time = 2000 
( diff = -5 ) - time = 2700 
( diff = -4 ) - time = 2700 
( diff = -3, -2 ) - time = 3000 
( diff = -1 ) - time = 4000 
( diff = 0 ) - time = 4500 
( diff = 1 ) - time = 5000 
( diff = 2,3,4,5 ) - time = 6000 
( diff = 6,7,8 ) - time = 7000 
( diff = 9 ) - time = 8000 

The technical skill also allows you to switch weapons more quickly! 
Here is the chart for weaponspeeds:  

level:  | speed: 
	|
tech 1  | Standard switch time 
tech 2  | 0.8 x Standard switch time 
tech 3  | 0.8 x Standard switch time 
tech 4  | 0.7 x Standard switch time 
tech 5  | 0.6 x Standard switch time 
tech 6  | 0.6 x Standard switch time 
tech 7  | 0.5 x Standard switch time 
tech 8  | 0.5 x Standard switch time 
tech 9  | 0.5 x Standard switch time 
tech 10 | 0.4 x Standard switch time
