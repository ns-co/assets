General hints and tactics for the map:

- learn the map, especially all the special ways and 
	different possibilitys

- there are three main ways: middle, left, right, use them 
	for team communication

- VIP: always use a different, never use the same way 
	again. so the tangos have to roam and normaly u 
	only met small groups of them

- VIP: never run away, never go on ur own, stay with 
	the seals

- Tango: u have to say the members which way u take 
	at the beginning of a round, if u have trouble 
	or u die the other members know where they come

- Tango: try to hide until u can see the VIP, the best 
	is if u can come from behind (high spe and ste)

- SEALs: always watch ur back, as soon as u stop too 
	long a tango can already be in ur back and kill 
	a lot of ppl. one guy should do this all the time

- SEALs: use fast silent scouts to look which way is save

- SEALs: the VIP says the way at the binngong of the 
	round, the VIP should not only run behind the 
	rushing SEALs

- SEALs: as soon as u kill a tango u have to hurry 
	because then they know where u are, perhaps go 
	back fast and try a complete different way
