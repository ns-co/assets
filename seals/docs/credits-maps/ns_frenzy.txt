Tango mission: 	Kill all enemies		
SEAL mission: 	Kill all enemies

--- Notes from the author
	This map is primarily designed for the Squad Assault gamemode. It's the first primarily made for this gamemode, so it's pretty much a testmap.
	If you would think some parts of this map are made of simpler mapping techniques, it's because it was rushed in the last phase of development.

--- Misc stuff
	Build time: ~3 months
	Compile time (external lightmaps, 8 bounces etc, p4 1.3 ghz, 384 rdram): ~15000 secs I think
