description:      REQUIRES multiplant.pk3
		  multiplant2.pk3 is an expansion pack for multiplant.pk3
		  ## palms of various polycounts from 2 to ~500
		  .md3 models and prefabs
====================================================
model information

most of these plants use a basic shader with simple GE128 transparency

i've included prefabs with collision and sound for the original multiplant pack.  
not recomended for the traditionally preferred "smoothly clipped" map.  
all triggers should be set to fire only once every 3-5 sec.

how to use        place multiplant2.pk3 in your /baseq3/ folder
                  choose one of the multiplant models from the model menu
			in Q3Radient
                  
====================================================
construction

base:           none
editor:         3DStudioMAX r3.1
other progs:    Pop'n'Fresh .md3 exporter
                
know bugs:      may consume carbon dioxide, add oxygen to your arena

build time:     these were built over a very long period of time, and 
		i've lost track of time spent actually modeling.
