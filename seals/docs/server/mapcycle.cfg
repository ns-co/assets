// OTHER - The unsuitable for default mapcycle maps (highly subjective)

// Letting people vote for these.

// People just dont like this, its too cramped. too many doors, claustrophobic.
//ns_ship

// Provides too little choice in terms of routes, sniper map. Mostly turns into
// TDM with little care for objectives.
//ns_junglechessna

// Stunning and cinematic map, needs many players. best reserved for special 
// events. people with too little memory may have trouble loading it as well.
//ns_ghettoship

// Again stunning map, needs many players, choice of routes may be too huge.
// people just dont like the gameplay of it, cant give a good reason why.
//ns_beachhouse

// Obviously like junglechessna this is a simple rectangular map, the choice of 
// routes are virtually non-existant. fun for sniping and pistol-only action.
//ns_canyon

// COMMUNITY MAPPACK

// Uncomment these if you have the community mappack for 1.91 installed!

//ns_skyscraperB
//ns_trainingcamp
//ns_substation
//ns_ziggurat
//ns_wog

// with the exception of this perhaps, suitable for few players or for fun.
//ns_lobby
