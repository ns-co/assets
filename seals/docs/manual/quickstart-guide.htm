The bywords of real SEAL team Commanders are equally applicable to playing Navy SEALs: Covert Operations. 
On the surface NS:CO may look familiar to fans of the fps realism genera, but NS:CO is something new, 
original and different! A hasty approach to just getting the game going and playing will almost certainly 
result in frustration and disappointment.
					</p><p class="medium">					
Navy SEALS: Covert Operations is not a difficult game to understand and play but it is different from what 
you may know from other fps realism shooters. With an emphasis on realism and player configuration NS:CO 
offers depth and realistic skill/class like variation that you won't find anywhere else. We recommend 
everyone reads the <a href="manual.htm" target="_blank">NS:CO Manual</a>, but realize you 
are anxious to play so we've compiled the essentials you need to understand and know for basic 
effectiveness in this Quick Start Guide. This guide does not include basic or detailed game configuration, 
please see the included NS:CO documentation:<br>
<a href="manual.htm" target="_blank">NS:CO Manual</a>, Skill Instruction Sheet, CVAR Sheet, and Commands Reference Sheet.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">					
KEEP READING: you will need to know and understand these essential features just to function in-game, so read on and save yourself a lot of time, frustrating experimentation, and dying.

						<p class="medium">					
TASS™ or "Ability System" is the core element to NS:CO player configuration. Through TASS™ you 
configure your attributes and skills; different abilities give you skill in certain areas at the 
expense of others that are required to access and effectively use specific weapons, weapon attachments 
and equipment. You get a starting number of experience points (often abbreviated "XP"), and additional 
points are awarded for kills and achieving objectives at the end of each round. All players also get 
experience points for time in-game so game-play won't get imbalanced. If a game gets out of hand and 
sould get lamed or become imbalanced TASS™ will award extra points to the suffering team; the successful 
team and players will always lead in experience points by some small margin however.
					</p><p class="medium">
<b>TASS™ abilities and their effects include:</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Accuracy</b> effects your weapon control accuracy when moving and jumping; 
		more accuracy points are required for certain weapons.</li>
	<li><b>Strength</b> effects your ability to control recoil and grenade throw range; 
		more strength points are required for certain heavier weapons.</li>
	<li><b>Stealth</b> effects how much noise you make running, sprinting, jumping and 
		climbing (see minimum requirement for using weapon supressors).</li>
	<li><b>Stamina</b> adjusts stamina and toughness, more stamina lets you sprint 
		longer, recover faster and sustain more injury.</li>
	<li><b>Technical</b> adjusts your skill in handling grenades, bomb defuse and 
		bandage times.</li>
	<li>
						<b>Speed</b> - adjusts your walking, running and 
    sprinting speed when not heavily encumbered. </li>
</ul>
					</p><p class="medium">
At the start of the game you must distribute your points to be effective; 
choose carefully! Starting points are limited by the server Administrator and at the 
beginning of a game you may feel very limited in certain abilities. Most players 
initially choose to put the bulk of their starting points in one area that best 
suits how they like to play. If there are specific weapons and attachments you want 
to use, select them in he weapons load-out to see the point requirements for those 
you are interested in (be sure you re-select the weapons and attachments you have 
enough points for or you will be loaded with game defaults in the next round).
					</p><p class="medium">
<b>Things to keep in mind:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Everyone has accurate single fire regardless of experience, but you need additional 
		Accuracy and Strength to control full-auto and high power weapons. </li>
	<li>Everyone can walk silently, but you need a good deal of Stealth to run silently, 
		and even more to sprint silently.</li>
	<li>All weapons, attachment and gear have realistic scale weight which will slow you 
		down (dynamic total weight is displayed in Player Configuration).</li>
</ul>
					</p><p class="medium">
Everyone will be more limited then you in some regards and more capable in others; 
this is one of the key challenges of NS:CO -- being mindful of your capabilities and 
limitations while staying cool under pressure to employ them decisively.
					</p><p class="medium">
See the <a href="manual.htm" target="_blank">NS:CO Manual</a> for more details about TASS™ 
and load-out integration, also check out the Skill Instruction Sheet for a detailed synopsis 
of of the TASS™ point structure.

						<p class="medium">					
NS:CO rolls with variations on five basic mission scenarios, all must be 
completed within a time limit and move with the pace and pressure of real 
surgical SEAL and Tango covert operations.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Bomb Defuse (BOMB): 
					</p><p class="medium">
One team has the mission to place explosives in one of several strategic locations. 
The opposing team must either prevent the explosives from being placed or defuse 
them once placed. NS:CO has very realistic (high tension!) bomb defusing tools, you 
may use the defusing tool and your skill to trace correct wires to cut, but this 
takes time and lots of it if you lack sufficient Technical experience points. You 
may also choose to "guess" and cut wires before they are traced, but with unfortunate 
consequences for your team if the bomb timer runs out or you guess wrong! 
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	VIP Secure (VIP-S):   
					</p><p class="medium">
One team has the mission of VIP protection for the duration of the round, the opposing 
team must assassinate the VIP; like all NS:CO and real SEAL missions you are under the 
pressure of time.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	VIP Rescue (VIP-R):   
					</p><p class="medium">
One team has to escort the VIP to one or more extraction points.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Information Retrieval (INFO):   
					</p><p class="medium">
One team must recover one or more document cases to one or more extraction points, the 
other team must prevent the case from being retrieved. Only the team attempting the 
recovery can move the case.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Assault (ASSAULT):  
					</p><p class="medium">
Teams must control one or more areas of a map preventing members of the opposing team 
from entering for a set amount of time. The timers start as soon as one team enters the 
area, but will reset as soon as an opposing team member enters the area. All areas must 
be captured for one team to win. This mission has variations where only one or both teams 
may capture areas. 
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Combined Missions (COMPLEX):  
					</p><p class="medium">
Combined Missions have multiple mission elements integrated into one map, for example
combining VIP-S & INFO on the Neighborhood map where the Tango team has a VIP and
document case, and the VIP can both move and hide the case; The SEAL Team must 
assassinate the VIP and recover the case to their extraction point.

for level specific mission details.

						<p class="mediumbold">
	Move and maneuver as you would in a real live fire situation.
					</p><p class="medium">
NS:CO weapon performance is very much in scale with reality; getting hit is traumatic 
and quickly lethal; avoid it!. NS:CO's reaistic scale weapons and movement make aimed 
single fire the most effective means for dispatching the opposition; "spray & pray" 
and "full flow" supression tactics work realistically but are realistically less 
effective.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Don't "B-Line"!   
					</p><p class="medium">
The shortest rout from A to B in NS:CO is not a straight line, it's the path that gets 
you there alive. The effective use of cover is vital for your survival.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Use stealth...   
					</p><p class="medium">
...appropriate camouflage, terrain, and slow careful movement; don't contrast yourself 
against the sky or other large high contrast surfaces making a conspicuous target. 
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Listen, 
					</p><p class="medium">
NS:CO has very realistic surface, distance and directional sound, betraying your and 
enemy positions. Move carefully, if you hear enemy in your area, walk and silently stalk 
them, approach all corners, barriers and doors with extreme caution.
					</p><p class="mediumbold">
	Use tactics appropriate to your abilities;
					</p><p class="medium">
If you focus experience on weapon control through Accuracy and Strength at the expense of 
Speed you should play more defensively.<br>
Speed and Stealth can make you an powerful raider but you need to be close and use surprise 
to successfully engage enemy.<br>
Other combinations and concentrations enable similar tactical advantages that you should 
apply while yielding to your limitations.

						<p class="medium">
Teamwork is essential to mission success in NS:CO and two reletively unskilled playes 
working carefully as a team can overpower and beat players of greater skill that 
outnumber them but work as individuals and don't coordinate their efforts.  
NS:CO offers a very friendly and feature complete radio system that you can easily 
access and quickly setup completely through the in-game menus; <br>
<b>Do It!</b>  Setup your custom in-game radio menus so they are easy for you to use, 
and make a habit of using them; it's enormous fun and will make NS:CO game-play much 
more rewarding.

NS:CO has a learning curve that will reward your initiative and patience with some of 
the richest and most fun team focused game-play you can find in FPS Realism multi-player 
gaming!  Most players are glad to help new players get acquainted but are often pretty 
deeply involved in game-play. If you have questions, wait till you have died or the end 
of the round and be patient for answers - many players have the message system turned 
off for all players but those on their team and may not even see what you're typing.
