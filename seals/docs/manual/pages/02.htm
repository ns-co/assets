                    self-explanatory. You will want to know and setup &quot;binds&quot;

						When  creating a server create it with the <b>Operations</b> game-type. 
                    Operations is the default NS:CO round-based game where players only respawn at the start of a round. If you die
						while a round is still in progress you will not respawn 
                    until the next round and will only be able spectate.<br><br>
						In addition to that <b>Operations</b> is also a team-based game-type. That means you have to decide
						on one of the two available teams; SEAL/s or Tangos before you are able to join the game.
						If you join a running game you have to wait until the current round is 
                    over before you
						spawn.<br><br>
						Rounds last five minutes by default, or until the objectives are completed, or all members
						of one (or both) teams are dead. The team that wins the round (by 
                    elimination or
						by achieving it's objectives) receives one point. The team with the most points wins.

					<td><p>Navy SEAL/s: Covert Operations very realistically 
                    scales injury and damage and does not offer traditional

						NS:CO has projectile code weapons with real ballistic 
                    physics; damage inflicted will depend on: range, caliber, 
                    the number of times, and where you are hit.&nbsp; The 
                    following details the consequences of location based damage:</p>

		<img src="images/02_damageloc.gif" align="right" width="200" height="400">
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						<font color="#953F3F"><b>HEAD</b></font><br>
				        Head shots are nearly always lethal. You may survive a 
                        direct head shot from a small caliber weapon at close 
                        range if you are wearing a Kevlar 
                        helmet  or larger caliber if you are at a great distance, but you will 
                        experience dramatic blurred vision and dizziness. Kevlar helmets can protect 
				from fatal head damage to some degree but can not protect 
				from larger caliber sniper rounds or multiple hits.<br><br>
						<font color="#5E619E"><b>CHEST</b></font><br>
				        The chest  is the second most lethal place to take damage&nbsp; 
                        organs. In the case of survival medium bleeding wounds 
                        are often the result. Kevlar armor affords some degree 
                        of chest protection.<br><br>
						<font color="#76507D"><b>ABDOMEN</b></font><br>
				The abdomen is the softest target of the body; shots to the 
                        abdomen cause hemorrhage but are not as immediately 
                        lethal as shots to the chest or head. Kevlar armor also 
                        affords some degree of abdominal protection.<br><br>
						<font color="#507D57"><b>ARMS</b></font><br>
				Damage to the arms is not lethal but is progressive.&nbsp; A hit 
                        to the arm causes progressive bleeding depending on 
                        severity. If you arm hit your weapon fire accuracy will 
                        suffer with according severity up to the point where you 
                        will be unable to shoot and your vision is blurred and 
                        shaking.<br><br>
						<font color="#7D6750"><b>LEGS</b></font><br>
				        Similar to arm damage except that being &quot;legged&quot; will 
                        effect your movement speed and your ability to jump. If 
                        you are legged under fire you do have the brief 
                        momentary ability to sprint out of fire based on how 
                        much stamina you have.</p>
					</blockquote>

						<p>In NS:CO you can die from direct either damage or due to a 
                        hemorrhage (massive blood loss). 
							Progressive blood loss will cause your vision to 
                        darken eventually leading to fainting and death. You 
                        should always Bandage as soon as possible to stop bleeding, 
                        reduce blood loss and mitigate certain damage effects. Bandaging 
							will require you to put down your weapon (does this 
                        automatically) you to put down your weapon "Bandaging" can also restore movement speed, 
							accuracy and vision to a certain degree, although you will never be as good as you had 
							been when unharmed. <br><br>

                    All the information described below is visible in both

	<img src="images/02_hudimg1.gif" align="right" width="400" height="300"></a><b>GPS</b><br>	
						The GPS is a toggleable display element that  shows 
relative teammate position, their 
						current health status and relative location of all mission related
						objectives.<br><br>
 							<b>Stamina Display</b><br>
						This bar shows how much stamina you currently have left for sprints;
						see section <a href="03.htm#03">3.2 Abilities</a> for 
details. The appearance of the Stamina Display differs in the two HUD variations 
but is the same orange color.<br><br>
							<b>Ammunition in Magazine</b><br>
						This element displays the current amount of ammunition 
remaining in your loaded magazine. It can
						be either a bar, a number or a graphical representation.<br><br>
							<b>Magazines Remaining</b><br>
						This element shows how magazines you have left in your inventory.
						Sometimes it's coupled with an icon to show the type of ammo left.<br><br>
 							<b>Fire-Mode</b><br>
						This small bar of bullets displays the current fire-mode you have 
selected, one bullet indicates semi-automatic or select fire, and five bullets 
indicate full-auto fire. 
						See section <a href="04.htm#02">4.1 Weapons</a> for details 
on which weapons support which fire modes.<br><br>
							<b>Iconographic Damage Locator or IDL</b><br>	

						This little guy is split up into parts and he shows 
location specific damage you are suffering;
						see section <a href="#03">2.2 Health and Damage</a> for details.</p>

						<p>Apart from those items that only deal with the player himself there are 
						also a few elements that have other functions. Those other items are  
						mission-based. Some are coupled with timers, some are without icons but all
						are showing the current status of various things. See section

						mechanics.

 							<b>Round Timer</b><br>	
						The Round Timer is shown next to a stopwatch icon and is 
                            the top most of the timer elements; the Round Timer 
                            displays remaining time for the current round. <br><br>
							<b>VIP</b><br>
						A small &quot;V&quot; in the middle of the stopwatch of the Round 
                            Timer clock icon is displayed when
						there is a VIP present in this map. If you are the VIP then the icon of the VIP is 
						shown in red.<br><br>
 							<b>Bomb Timer</b><br>
						    If you're the designated Demolitions Specialist the 
                            bomb icon (third element from top) will be red. Once 
                            a bomb
						    is placed a grey bomb icon will appear for all 
                            players with a count down timer; when this time runs out the bomb 
                            detonates.<br><br>
							<b>Assault Fields</b><br>
						For every assault field (up to a maximum of four) within this map you see one icon of
						the assault field with a small number in its center. Once one of those assault fields is
						    occupied a timer begins the count down next to it. 
                            Once this timer has run out the assault field had 
                            been captured.<br><br>
 							<b>Briefcase</b><br>
						    If you carry a briefcase then small red icon will 
                            appear on the left hand side of the screen.

						<p>There is also an inventory element (second element 
                        from top) that can be toggled on or off that displays

					<blockquote>
