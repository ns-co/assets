						<p>
TASS� or "The Ability System" is the core element to NS:CO player configuration. Through TASS� you
configure your attributes and skills; different abilities give you skill in certain areas at the
expense of others that are required to access and effectively use specific weapons, weapon attachments
and equipment. You get a starting number of experience points (abbreviated "XP"), and additional
points are awarded staying alive, completing mission objectives and killing
                    opposing team members. All players also get
experience points for time in-game so game-play won't get imbalanced. If a game gets out of hand and
should get lamed or become imbalanced TASS� will award extra points to the suffering team; the successful
team and players will always lead in experience points by some small margin however.
					The available TASS� abilities include</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>

						<b>Technical</b> <b>- </b>adjusts your skill in handling
                        grenades, bomb defuse and bandage times.<br><br>
						<b>Accuracy - </b>effects your weapon control accuracy
                        when moving and jumping; more accuracy points are
                        required for certain weapons.<br><br>
						<b>Strength</b> - adjusts your ability to control
                        recoil, grenade throw range; more strength points are
                        required for heavier weapons.<br><br>
						<b>Stealth</b> - effects how much noise you make
                        running, sprinting, jumping and climbing.&nbsp; Noise is
                        reduced progressively for loud sounds first like
                        jumping, not incrementally where every noise you make is
                        decreased gradually with more XP. There are minimum
                        stealth requirements for using weapon suppressors.<br><br>
						<b>Stamina</b> - adjusts stamina and toughness, more
                        stamina lets you sprint longer, sustain more injury and
                        recover faster from exhausted stamina and injury.<br><br>
						<b>Speed</b> - adjusts your walking, running and
                        sprinting speed when not heavily encumbered.

						</p>
					</blockquote>

						<p>An ability can never be below 1 and you always start with
                        minim of 10 pool experience points to distribute.
						If you're joining an game in progress you get the average amount of
                        experience points the team you are joining has.
						</p>

						<p>To increase an ability value use the player menu and click on the chosen ability. You will have to
                        use as
						many of your pool XP as the current level of the ability
                        you want to raise to raise that ability one point; so if
                        your current Speed ability is 5 you will need 6 free
                        points to raise your Speed Ability one point to level 6.<br>
						&nbsp;</p>

						<p>As mentioned you win additional XP for staying
                        alive, completing mission objectives and killing
                        opposing team members. So for example; if you survive a
                        round you gain one XP. if you kill two enemies within
                        one round you gain two more XP, if you successfully complete a mission
                        objective you are awarded XP depending on the type of mission.

					<p>To make your player model look unique every player can select a face

						There are three types of accessories: headwear, eyewear and

                    affectations and hats available to the Tangos not available
                    to the SEAL/s and vise versa. You can select your Head-Stuff either via the
                    &quot;Setup Menu&quot; when you start the game or if you're playing you can do this via the
                    &quot;Player Menu&quot;.
						Some accessories are automatically turned off if you
                    select certain equipment; for example if
						you're wearing a helmet and you have a hat selected in
                    Head-Stuff� the helmet will replace the hat.</p>
