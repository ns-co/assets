	Hint: - Its very important that all trigger_explosion(s) of one info_bomb_disarm have the targetname of the 
		target from the info_bomb_disarm
	      - With the delay feature u can create the nice effect that the big explosions 'wanders' through the
		room, if u place a lot of trigger_explosion with different delays
	      - Remember that the explosion is not able to gro through solid. So be sure that the explosions reach 
		all places u want
