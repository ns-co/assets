Introduction to GPS Entity Placement
--------------------------------------

There are two different ways to manipulate the amount/type 
of entities in the GPS display.

	- Using the built-in ingame Radar Entity Placer
	- Editing the briefing file manually.

We'll start in this tutorial with the more common, and of 
course easier way to place entities.

There are 5 built-in types you can place.

	- Assaultfield marker
	- Bombspot marker
	- Vip rescue marker
	- Briefcase marker
	- Briefcase returnpoint marker


Using the built-in GPS Entity Placer
--------------------------------------

Loadup your map with the "devmap" command, and join as a 
player (The team you join does not matter ). 
Walk up to the point where you want to place your marker, 
type /editradar in the console and push enter. Leave the 
console, as you should know notice a radar menu popped up. 
Use your mouse to control it, and select the marker point 
to place.
Once you are finsihed, select the save/write out function 
in the same menu.

You should have the briefing file NOT IN A PAK FILE placed 
in briefing/, then it will append the [RADAR] entry 
including all it's entities to your file.
If you haven't placed it out of a pak file, it will simply 
create a file called MAPNAME.brf in briefing/ with the 
[RADAR] contents.
Simply cut & paste this entire selection to YOUR briefing 
file.

Save the briefing file, and fire up NS:CO. 
The markers should be visible.


Editing the Briefing file manually
--------------------------------------

Open your briefing file for your map with notepad or a 
similar text editor of your choice.
Go to the end of the file (just before $EOF, this is the 
end of file marker) and type:

	[RADAR]

after this entry you can add your entities in this format

	<TYPE, one character> <X> <Y> <Z>

And then end the GPS entity entry by adding :

	[END]

here are a few examples:

	[RADAR]
	E 2608.466797 -2506.415039 276.206848
	B -190.720078 784.729187 226.125000
	[END]

The built-in valid types are:

	A - Assaultfield marker
	X - Bombspot marker
	V - Vip rescue marker
	B - Briefcase marker
	E - Briefcase returnpoint marker

You could add even more markers, if these don't suite your 
map. If you need, for example, a marker that shows you that 
you have to destroy a func_explosive.
You could add a new type, make sure that the char you use 
is not used by another OFFICIAL MAP:

Z = Func Explosive

Then you would also have to create a new shader:

gfx/radar/radar_Z

See our shaders in scripts/nsq3_radar.scripts - Then you will 
also have to create a graphic that is used by the shader, see 
gfx/radar/ for our built in radar graphics.

After you've done all this you can add your new type to the 
briefing file, i.e.:

	[RADAR]
	Z 2608.466797 -2506.415039 276.206848 
	[END]

Save your briefing file and start NS:CO to verify everything 
worked correctly.
